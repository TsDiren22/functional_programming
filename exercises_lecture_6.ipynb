    "The lottery wants your help. Their system makes use of [event sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) (more on that next period in Solution Architecture!). For now that means that they do not store a current amount in the prize pot, or a current profit, they only store events in a database. The state of the system needs to be computed by looping over all events. Events happen when a ticket is bought and when a winner is drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel it coming...? We want those events to be a monoid! Then we can simply use the F# `List.sum` to get the current state of the lottery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the rules of the lottery:\n",
    "- A ticket costs €10, of which €7 goes into the prize pot and €3 is profit for the lottery.\n",
    "- The buyer of the ticket gets to choose a 3 digit code on the ticket.\n",
    "- The ticket wins when the 3 digit code is drawn at the end of the month.\n",
    "- When a draw happened and there is a winner the prize pot is empty, but the profits are unchanged.\n",
    "- When a draw happened and there is no winner the prize pot remains filled.\n",
    "- After a draw all tickets become invalid and you have to buy a code again to win with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps should help you implement the monoid structure for the events:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Declare a type `Event` and give the enum (discriminated union) three values. \n",
    "    - A `Ticket` with a string in it for the code on the ticket.\n",
    "    - A `Draw` with a string in it for the winning code.\n",
    "    - A `Pot` with a tuple of an `int`, `int`, and `Set<string` in it. The first int is the prize, the second the profit\n",
    "    . The set contains all competing ticket codes.\n",
    "2. Write a function `addEvents` that adds together any two events according to the business rules above. (Also take a look at the test code below.)\n",
    "3. Give the `Event` a `+` method and a `Zero` element.\n",
    "4. Test your implementation with the code below."
