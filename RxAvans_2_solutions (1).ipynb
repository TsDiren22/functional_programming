    "On Brightspace you find a simple npm project with some instructions to build a small RxJS project. This is to refresh your RxJS skills.\n",

    "## The goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of RxAvans is to have a small library that provides an observable and you can subscribe to that observable. It is a lazy evaluated library, meaning that nothing happens until someone is listening to the observable. Just like in the RxJS example. Also just like in the RxJS example we want to build a pipeline of functions like filter and map. Let's go!\n",

    "We start simple. The first step we'll take is to construct a function that decorates functions with extra behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok... so what does that sentence actually mean? Maybe the simplest example of a function decorator is a logger. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we want in this example is to log the argument of a function, without changing what the function does, and for any function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you find the silly function `unchanged`. It takes another function as argument and returns a function that simply calls the function you provided as argument. Examine this function `unchanged` and make sure you understand what is happening here before reading on."
