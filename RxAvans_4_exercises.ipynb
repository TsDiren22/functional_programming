    "Let's examine this example together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember we are trying to build a reactive pipeline like RxJS:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// RxJS:\n",
    "from([1,2,3])\n",
    "    .pipe(\n",
    "        filter(val => val % 2 == 0),\n",
    "        map(val => 3 * val)\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    .subscribe(console.log)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to recognize the `producer` from the previous sheet about lazy evaluation. The producer only starts producing values when it gets called with the `observer`, so only when there is an actualy observer the reactive pipeline starts working.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then `doNothing` also looks a lot like a lazy evaluated function... because it is! However, `producer` is at the start of the reactive pipeline, while `doNothing` is a link in the middle. So comparing it to the RxJS example `producer` is `from([1,2,3])`, while `doNothing` would be a function in `pipe(...)`, like `filter` and `map` in the example. `subscribe(console.log)` in RxJS plays the same role as `intermediate (printfn \"received: %i\")` in our example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to understand how `doNothing` works. It gets called with the previous link in the chain (in this case the function `producer`). `doNothing` then returns a function that you can call with the next link in the chain (in this case the function `printfn \"received: %i\"`). When it gets called with the printfn it in turn calls the previous link in the chain (`producer`) with some lambda function (`fun data -> next data`). All this lambda function does is pass on the data it receives from the previous link to the next link in the chain. So we made a reactive pipeline that does nothing (hence the name `doNothing`!). \n",
    "\n",
    "Phew... that's a lot. Read that paragraph a couple of times and then let's make the pipeline do something useful!"
